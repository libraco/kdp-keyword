# KDP Keyword Organizer

This is a simple web tool to help Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) authors organize their book keywords for Amazon.

## Functionality

The KDP Keyword Organizer helps you:

*   **Optimize Keyword Usage:**  It's designed around the seven keyword fields in the KDP Bookshelf, each with a 50-character limit.
*   **Intelligent Keyword Arrangement:**  You input a list of keywords, and the tool arranges them to maximize each field, ensuring efficient use of space.
*   **Keyword Cleaning:** It cleans up keywords by removing punctuation and extra spaces, and converts them to lowercase.
*   **Duplicate Removal:**  It identifies and removes duplicate keywords.
*   **Character Counting:**  It provides character counts for both the input keywords and each output keyword box, helping you stay within Amazon's limits.
*   **Copy to Clipboard:**  Each keyword box has a "Copy" button for easy pasting into the KDP Dashboard.

## How to Use

1.  **Enter Keywords:** In the "Step One" box, enter your keywords. Separate keywords or phrases with commas or new lines.
2.  **Organize Keywords:** Click the "ORGANIZE KEYWORDS" button. The tool will process your keywords and distribute them into seven keyword boxes in "Step Two".
3.  **Review and Copy:** Review the organized keywords in "Step Two".  Use the "Copy" button next to each box to copy the keywords and paste them into the corresponding keyword fields in your Amazon KDP Dashboard.
4.  **Notices:** Check the "Notices" area for any duplicate keywords removed or keywords that couldn't fit into the boxes.
